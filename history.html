                        <p>The adventure begins in a small Polish city, where I spent the first 19 years of my life.</p>
                        <p>During this time, I completed basic education in classes with a mathematical profile with not
                            bad results.</p>
                        <p>However, for most of the time, I focused more on developing my character and building my
                            personality.</p>
                        <p>I spent hundreds of hours playing games, which helped me develop basic skills such
                            asstrategic thinking, problem-solving, stress resistance, cooperation, goal-setting, and
                            many others.</p>

                        <p>I also spent a significant amount of time reading books, mainly in the fantasy genre, which
                            helped me develop a better imagination, broaden my perspectives and helped me establish my
                            life values.</p>
                        <p>A significant part of this period was also consumed by comics. It is not possible to read
                            hundreds of shounen manga without coding my brain in such a way that I would never be able
                            to give up.</p>

                        <p>I also had the opportunity to learn to play several instruments, mainly drums. Through this

                            skills.</p>
                        <p>By the end of this period, my character was ready and willing for adventures and further

                            me and I wanted to learn more about them.</p>
                        <p>In a short time, I greatly expanded my knowledge of the basics of computer science,
                            databases, the history of IT, operating systems, networks, and websites. I also learned the
                            basics of my first programming language, which was C#.</p>

                            lectures on the history of art and completed a professional drawing course.</p>
                        <p>This knowledge allowed me to start an adventure as a freelance graphic designer, which I will

                        <p>One of the conditions for completing my education at the Higher School of Banking was to gain
                            professional experience through an internship at a chosen IT-related company.</p>
                        <p>I decided to choose something related to databases, because it was a topic that I was
                            fascinated with at the time.</p>
                        <p>So, I began my internship at the Poznań-based company "ERP System", which, as the name
                            suggests, dealt with the implementation and support of ERP systems for companies.</p>

                        <p>The company was small, but it was full of experienced backend developers from whom I had the
                            opportunity to learn a lot.</p>
                        <p>I significantly expanded my knowledge in areas such as: databases, data management, SQL and
                            SQL server, cloud data, implementation and support of ERP systems. I also got familiar with
                            the whole Comarch toolkit which I had to use on a daily basis.</p>

                        <p>My standard day at the company involved finding data for customers by entering appropriate
                            functions in SQL, learning and using Comarch programs.</p>
                        <p>My first internship was definitely a worthwhile experience, I gained many backend skills, but
                            I lacked the opportunity to show imagination and creativity, so I decided that this
                            profession was ultimately not for me.</p>

                        <p>Several times I was even commissioned to prepare a print on a building wall or a shop booth.

                            waste my vacation and went on my first season by the Polish sea. I didn't really know what I
                            was getting into at the time, but I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and try something
                            new.</p>

                            learned the basics and became a little more skilled in this field every day.</p>
                        <p>To stand out from my group of coworkers, I started learning about sales techniques,
                            negotiations and the products I was selling.</p>
                        <p>Thanks to this tactic, in a short time, I left my colleagues behind with my sales results.

                            with a friend and a familiar investor.</p>
                        <p>In order to do this, I had to create a business model as quickly as possible, plan a budget,
                            prepare the sales point from scratch, establish contact with many wholesalers, and start
                            selling as soon as possible.</p>

                        <p>With the help of friends and colleagues, we were able to achieve all of this in a matter of
                            days.</p>

                        <p>The shop that we opened sold bubble-related toys. I came up with the idea of using a machine

                            boardwalk and encourage them to buy products.</p>
                        <p>The idea turned out to be a success, the promenade was filled with fascinating bubbles for
                            children and sales were growing.</p>

                            to ordering and transporting products, managing the company's finances and logistics.
                            Ultimately, at the end of the season, the profit from the sale of products exceeded the
                            costs of maintaining the company, but only slightly.</p>

                        <p>After this adventure, I decided to take a break from coastal seasons and find more stable

                            offer in Germany and we took it.</p>
                        <p>I took a job as a warehouse assistant at OFTEC Oberflächentechnik company. I have never
                            worked
                            typically physically before, but I am not afraid of new challenges, so I decided to give it
                            a try.

                        <p>The tasks assigned to me initially were not too complicated, mainly consisting of loading
                            and emptying the production line.</p>
                        <p>In a short time, my supervisors noticed my commitment and professionalism, which led to more
                            complicated tasks being assigned to me, such as operating machines and distributing parts
                            between stations.</p>

                        <p>After a short time, my endurance increased so much that I was able to take overtime every
                            day.</p>
                        <p>I didn't learn too many new things in this job, but I greatly improved my endurance, both
                            physical and mental.</p>
                        <p>When the time came, I quit my job at OFTEC and for my next adventure I chose to return to my

                        <p>After returning from Germany, I was in a good financial situation, so I decided to take the
                            opportunity and spend the next few months learning skills that would open doors to
                            previously unavailable adventures.</p>
                        <p>I decided that in the near future I will become a Frontend Developer, because it's a
                            profession that well combines design and programming, and these are two subjects that I am
                            happy to spend time on.</p>

                        <p>To have an idea of what exactly skills I need, I started a course on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy.com</a> - career
                            path: frontend developer.</p>
                        <p>Soon after that, I started writing this website you are reading right now. I hope you like
                            the results of my work.</p>
                        <p>In addition to courses on the website, I get most of my knowledge from technical
                            documentation, tutorials, and forums such as stackoverflow.</p>

                        <p>I adopted a learning strategy by creating projects and solving problems when they arise using
                            various technologies, in order to learn them effectively.</p>
                        <p>I began with the basics: HTML, CSS, JS. When I gained confidence in them, I started expanding
                            my knowledge of libraries, frameworks and other tools.</p>

                        <p>Then I built several less and more complex projects, mainly based on React.</p>
                        <p>I invested hundreds of hours in learning and every day I am getting closer to achieving a
                            professional level in this field.</p>
                        <p>My next adventure plan is to work as a Frontend Developer.</p>
